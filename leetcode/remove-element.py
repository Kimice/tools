# https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/


# Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.
#
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
#
# The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
#
# Example:
# Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
#
# Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
